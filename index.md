My name is Daphne Kontaxi, born April 21 in 1997 and I'm 22 years old. I am from Greece and raised in Athens. I graduated from the Arsakio School in 2015. Now I am at the Department of Interior Architecture at the University of West Attica. From 2018 to 2019 I was working as an assistant architect in a technical architectural office. In addition to some basic computer programs such as world, excel, power point, I have very good knowledge in other programs, especially design such as archicad, autocad, photoshop and sketch up. I speak English at a good level and French at a moderate level. Lastly, I do a lot of photo editing, line art and free drawing.
